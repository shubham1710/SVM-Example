# SVM-Example
In this repository, we will be looking at a simple project in which we will be classifying river water into different categories on the basis of pollution levels using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model.

In this example, we have used linear kernel but you are free to choose kernel of your choice based on the data requirements. We have here used the same dataset for training as well as testing but you can split the dataset into training and testing data by the use of skitik learn train and test library.
